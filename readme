üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

Flask Server Disconnected:

Ensure app.py is running (python app.py).
Check if http://localhost:5000 is accessible.


Ollama Errors:

Verify the Ollama server is running (ollama serve).
Confirm the model (ibm/granite3.3:2b) is pulled.


File Upload Issues:

Ensure files are under 200MB.
Only use supported formats: PDF, MP3/WAV, or valid YouTube URLs.


JSON Parsing Errors:

If you see "Failed to parse JSON" errors, check the server logs for details (app.py logs the request_id).
Ensure the Ollama model is correctly configured.


Slow Processing:

Large files or videos may take time to process. Be patient or try smaller files.
